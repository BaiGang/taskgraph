/*
The topology is a data structure implemented by application, and
used by framework implementation to setup/manage the event according to
topology defined here. The main usage is:
a. At beginning of the framework initialization for each task, framework
   call the SetTaskID so that the singleton Topology knows which taskID it
   represents.
b. At beginning of each epoch, the framework implementation (on each task)
   will call GetLinkTypes and GetNeighbors with given epoch, so that it knows
   how to setup watcher for node failures.

// Each Topology might have many epochs. The topology of each epoch
// might be different.

	// This method is called once by framework implementation. So that

	GetLinkTypes() []string

	// This returns the neighbors of given link for this node at this epoch.
